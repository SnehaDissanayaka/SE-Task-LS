1. For Question 1 the answers can be tested in Q1/output.html.
2. For Question 2 the answer is included in Q2 folder.
3. Note : For Question 3 could not use w3schools Try-SQL Editor ( non of my browsers did not support WebSQL, limiting the database accesibility). A MySQL Docker image (MySQL 8.1.0) was used to execute the queries.
